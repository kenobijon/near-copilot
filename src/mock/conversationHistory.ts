        'Here\'s an example of a basic Chatbot UI using Next.js with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. \n\nFirst, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new Next.js project:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app chatbot-ui\ncd chatbot-ui\n```\n\n2. Install the necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest\nnpm install @types/react @types/node typescript\n```\n\n3. Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```bash\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\n4. Open `tailwind.config.js` and update the `purge` section as follows:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  purge: [\'./pages/**/*.{tsx, ts}\', \'./components/**/*.{tsx, ts}\'],\n  // ... rest of the code ...\n```\n\n5. Create the `styles/globals.css` file with the following content:\n\n```css\n@import \'tailwindcss/tailwind.css\';\n```\n\n6. Create a new `components/Chatbot.tsx` file with the following content:\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\';\n\nconst Chatbot: React.FC = () => {\n  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<string[]>([]); // Track chat messages\n\n  const handleSendMessage = () => {\n    // Logic to handle sending a message\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100">\n      <div className="mb-4">\n        {messages.map((message, index) => (\n          <div key={index} className="p-2 mb-2 rounded bg-white">\n            {message}\n          </div>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n      <input\n        type="text"\n        placeholder="Type your message..."\n        className="p-2 border border-gray-400 rounded"\n      />\n      <button\n        onClick={handleSendMessage}\n        className="ml-2 px-4 py-2 text-white bg-blue-500 rounded"\n      >\n        Send\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Chatbot;\n```\n\n7. Open `pages/index.tsx` and replace the existing code with the following:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from \'react\';\nimport Chatbot from \'../components/Chatbot\';\n\nconst Home: React.FC = () => (\n  <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen">\n    <Chatbot />\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Home;\n```\n\n8.

        'Certainly! Here\'s a Python code snippet that calculates the sum of numeric array elements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize the sum variable\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the array\n    for num in arr:\n        # Check if the element is numeric\n        if isinstance(num, (int, float)):\n            # Add the numeric element to the sum\n            total_sum += num\n    \n    return total_sum\n\n# Test the code with an example array\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = calculate_sum(array)\nprint("Sum of array elements:", result)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `calculate_sum` function takes an array as input and iterates through each element. It checks if the element is numeric (either an `int` or a `float`) using the `isinstance` function. If the element is numeric, it adds it to the `total_sum` variable. Finally, the function returns the sum of the numeric elements.\n\nIn the example, the code calculates the sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and prints the result as `15`.

        'Alternatively, you can also use the built-in `sum` function in Python to calculate the sum of numeric array elements. Here\'s an example:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(arr):\n    # Use the sum function to calculate the sum of the numeric array elements\n    total_sum = sum(num for num in arr if isinstance(num, (int, float)))\n    return total_sum\n\n# Test the code with an example array\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = calculate_sum(array)\nprint("Sum of array elements:", result)\n```\n\nThis code follows a more concise approach by utilizing a generator expression and the `sum` function. The generator expression filters out non-numeric elements from the array, and the `sum` function calculates the sum of the remaining elements. The output will be the same as before, where the sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is `15`.',

The method iterates over each element in the array and adds it to the `totalSum` variable.\n\nIn the `main` method, we create an example `double` array `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5]`. We then call the `calculateSum` method, passing the array to it. Finally, we print the sum of the array elements.\n\nWhen you run the code, it will calculate the sum of the elements `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5]` and print the result as `17.5`.\n\nFeel free to modify the array elements as per your requirement.',

It initializes the `totalSum` variable to 0 and iterates over each element in the array using a `foreach` loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the element is numeric using the `is_numeric` function and adds it to the `totalSum`.\n\nIn the example, we create an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and pass it to the `calculateSum` function.

        'In Tailwind CSS, you can add a gap between words by using the `space` utility classes. Tailwind CSS provides a set of spacing utilities that allow you to add margins, padding, and gaps between elements.\n\nTo add a gap between words, you can use the `space-x` class on the parent element. The `x` in `space-x` indicates a horizontal gap.\n\nHere\'s an example of using the `space-x` utility class to add a gap between words:\n\n```html\n<p class="space-x-2">\n  This<span>is</span><span>a</span><span>gap</span><span>between</span><span>words</span>.\n</p>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `space-x-2` class adds a 2 units horizontal gap (equivalent to 0.5rem or 8px) between the words.\n\nYou can adjust the spacing value to achieve the desired gap between words. The `space-x` utility class is responsive, meaning you can add different gaps on different screen sizes by using different utility classes like `md:space-x-4` or `lg:space-x-6`.\n\nRemember to include the Tailwind CSS framework by either linking to a CDN or compiling your custom CSS file with Tailwind CSS classes.',
